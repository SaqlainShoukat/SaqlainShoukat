    <h1>Full-Duplex Mode</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p><strong>Full-Duplex Mode</strong>: A mode of communication where data transmission is bidirectional and simultaneous. Both devices can send and receive data at the same time.</p>
    
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bidirectional and Simultaneous</strong>: Communication can occur in both directions at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Channels</strong>: Often requires separate channels or the use of sophisticated techniques to avoid interference.</li>
        <li><strong>Example Devices</strong>: Telephones, modern Ethernet networks, and wireless communication systems.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Allows for faster and more efficient communication as both parties can transmit data simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Communication</strong>: Ideal for applications requiring real-time, interactive communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Performance</strong>: Reduces latency and increases the performance of communication systems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Complexity</strong>: More complex to implement and manage due to the need for handling simultaneous transmission and reception.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Typically more expensive due to the need for more advanced technology and infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Telephony</strong>: Telephone systems where both parties can talk and listen simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Communication</strong>: Modern Ethernet networks and Wi-Fi that support simultaneous upload and download of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Conferencing</strong>: Systems that allow participants to see and hear each other in real-time.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Comparison with Other Modes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplex</strong>: In simplex mode, communication is unidirectional, with no ability for the receiver to send data back to the sender.</li>
        <li><strong>Half-Duplex</strong>: In half-duplex mode, communication is bidirectional but not simultaneous. Each device can send and receive data, but not at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Examples in Technology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Telephones</strong>: Devices where both parties can talk and listen simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Ethernet Networks</strong>: Networks that allow for simultaneous data transmission and reception.</li>
        <li><strong>Wi-Fi Communication</strong>: Wireless networks that support simultaneous upload and download of data.</li>
    </ol>

     <strong>Explanation of Diagram:</strong>
    <p>The diagram illustrates the full deplex  modes of data transmission,In full-duplex mode, data flows in both directions simultaneously, allowing Device A and Device B to send and receive data at the same time, shown by arrows pointing both ways concurrently.</p>
